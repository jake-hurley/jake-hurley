        <h1>Code Readability Primer</h1>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h3>What code readability habit will you begin implementing today?</h3>
        
        <p>
            Something that I already had an awarness of prior to this section was indentation. Although I knew the main concept, there were a couple of little details like text content indentation I had not learnt so I will implement those.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Does code readability seem important to you, or unnecessarily fussy? Justify your answer.</h3>
        
        <p>
            Coming from a career where keeping things like files and directories tidy and functional for other artists to work on is critical to everybody getting along. I am very aware of how important it is for your work to be readable for other developers.
            It extends beyond simply being readable for others. It affects the efficiency of pulling apart your code to solve problems too. The cleaner it is, the easier literally every other task becomes. 
        </p>
        
        
        
        <h1>Code Readability Challenge</h1>

        <hr>
        
        <h3>As a developer, how important do you think indenting is?</h3>
        
        
        
        <h3>Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?</h3>
        
        
        
        <h3>What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that? Is your _downloads_ folder a reflection of that?</h3>
        
        
        
        
        
        <h1>Testing</h1>

        <hr>
        
        ```
        function testSum(){
            var expected = 7
            var actual = sum(5, 2)
        
            if (actual != expected) {
                console.log("It's broken..")
            } else {
                console.log("It works!")
            }
        }
        ```
        <h3>Have a go at writing a function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`: </h3>
        
        
        
        
        <h3>Do you think you would prefer using Unit Testing or Test Driven Development? Why?</h3>
        
        
        
        <h3>How could these techniques be used together to make code that is reliable?</h3>
        
        
        
        <h3>Was your initial response to the idea of testing, "That sounds useful" or "That sounds like a hassle"? Why?</h3>
        
        
        
        
        
        <h1>Repl.it - Code in your browser</h1>

        <hr>
        
        <h3>What was your first impression of the Repl.it website?</h3>
        
        
        
        <h3>How did you find using it in practice? Confusing? Useful?</h3>
        
        
        
        <h3>When you say the name of the website in your head, how are you pronouncing it? "REPLIT"? "REP-ILL-IT"? "REPELL-IT"?</h3>
        
        
        
        
        <h1>Problem Solving and Pseudocode </h1>

        <hr>
        
        <h3>Pick two problem solving techniques you would like to put into practice. Which ones have you chosen?</h3>
        
        
        
        <h3>How will you implement these techniques into your day to day coding flow? How will you make sure that you actually do them?</h3>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <h1>JavaScript Variables and Object Types</h1>

        <hr>
        
        <h3>How did you find working through the Variables and Objects kata?</h3>
        
        <p>
            I found it pretty simple, none of the problems had me stuck. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Did you look at the tests while coding the kata? Was it helpful?</h3>
        
        <p>
            I pretty much tested after every change I made, it makes it a lot easier to back and forth when you change things rather than making a lot of changes and then not knowing what part isnt working.
        </p>
        
        
        
        <h1>Manipulating JavaScript Objects</h1>

        <hr>
        
        <h3>What was the highlight of this kata for you?</h3>
        
        <p>
            I think the satisfaction overall of solving problems without Google or lots of frustration is the highlight of exercises like these.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Did you find you preferred following the steps given to you or using the test outputs in your repl? Why?</h3>
        
        <p>
            I preffered to use the Repl.it output. It allowed me to keep everything focussed on one window instead of jumping between two. I also prefer to look at the thing giving me the outputs incase theres any weird mismatches in data.
        </p>

        <h3>What was a surprising moment for you in this Gradebook Kata?</h3>
        
        
        
        <h3>Did you go back and rewrite code as you got to new steps? Is there anything you would change about your final code?</h3>
