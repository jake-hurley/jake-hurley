        <h1>Code Readability Primer</h1>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h3>What code readability habit will you begin implementing today?</h3>
        
        <p>
            Something that I already had an awarness of prior to this section was indentation. Although I knew the main concept, there were a couple of little details like text content indentation I had not learnt so I will implement those.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Does code readability seem important to you, or unnecessarily fussy? Justify your answer.</h3>
        
        <p>
            Coming from a career where keeping things like files and directories tidy and functional for other artists to work on is critical to everybody getting along. I am very aware of how important it is for your work to be readable for other developers.
            It extends beyond simply being readable for others. It affects the efficiency of pulling apart your code to solve problems too. The cleaner it is, the easier literally every other task becomes. 
        </p>
        
        
        
        <h1>Code Readability Challenge</h1>

        <hr>
        
        <h3>As a developer, how important do you think indenting is?</h3>
        
        <p>
            It is extremely important. To me it is just another form of professionalism, and a baseline skill for being taken seriously as a developer.  
        </p>
        
        <h3>Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?</h3>
        
        <p>
            Definitely tabs! The less times I have to press a button, the better. 
        </p>
        
        
        <h3>What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that? Is your _downloads_ folder a reflection of that?</h3>
        
        <p>
            I try my best to keep my workspace tidy for anything work or study related. My physical and digital desktop is always tidy at the start of a project, but tends to be a mess closer to the end. When it comes to directories and files, I try to have a system of files ready for projects so when I come to making the projects. I know where everything belongs before I start.
        </p>
        
        
        
        <h1>Testing</h1>

        <hr>
        
        ```
        function testSum(){
            var expected = 7
            var actual = sum(5, 2)
        
            if (actual != expected) {
                console.log("It's broken..")
            } else {
                console.log("It works!")
            }
        }
        ```
        <h3>Have a go at writing a function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`: </h3>
        
        <!-- sum isnt a pre defined function so I would just have to write a function for that..... -->
        <pre>
            <code>
                function sum(a,b) {
                    result = a + b;
                    return result 
                }
        
                testSum()
                
            </code>
        </pre>
       
        <!-- Or I can just change the function to not use the sum seeing as the function is so simple. -->
        
        <pre>
            <code>
                function testSum(){
                    var expected = 7
                    var actual = 5 + 2;
                
                    if (actual != expected) {
                        console.log("It's broken..")
                    } else {
                        console.log("It works!")
                    }
                }
                
            </code>
        </pre>
       


        <h3>Do you think you would prefer using Unit Testing or Test Driven Development? Why?</h3>
        
        <p>
            I think in all honesty I would use both. Test Driven Development is a good way to establish a working structure of a program before getting to intesely into details not knowing if something fully works or not. 
            Unit testing is a great way to apply test driven development by structuring your unit testing in the same way you plan to structure your program. I see them working better together than each individually on their own.
        </p>
        
        <h3>How could these techniques be used together to make code that is reliable?</h3>
        
        <p>
            Seeing as Testing Driven Development relies on testing the structural aspects of a program, Unit testing fits perfectly into this. It breaks down the structure of a program into smaller functions. This way you can plan your structure based on the unit tests you need to pass before you even write the main flesh of the code.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Was your initial response to the idea of testing, "That sounds useful" or "That sounds like a hassle"? Why?</h3>
        
        <p>
            I understand why its there, and ideally my code would magically work without the need of in depth testing. But I know that is not the case and testing is absolutely needed in order to either fix a bug or optimize a feature. I can see use for it beyond simply getting a pass or fail on a feature.
            To me it seems like it will be a way to look into my code and further optimize or refactor or tidy unneccary elements. 
        </p>
        
        
        
        <h1>Repl.it - Code in your browser</h1>

        <hr>
        
        <h3>What was your first impression of the Repl.it website?</h3>
        
        <p>
            yay another thing to code in -_-.
        </p>
        
        <h3>How did you find using it in practice? Confusing? Useful?</h3>
        
        <p>
            After using it in practice, I felt more comfortable and saw the use for it. It is nice having an output that doesnt requrie laucnhing a file on chrome and constantly jumping between browser and editor.
        </p>
        
        <h3>When you say the name of the website in your head, how are you pronouncing it? "REPLIT"? "REP-ILL-IT"? "REPELL-IT"?</h3>
        
        <p>
            Something along the lines of Reple it.
        </p>
        
        
        
        <h1>Problem Solving and Pseudocode </h1>

        <hr>
        
        <h3>Pick two problem solving techniques you would like to put into practice. Which ones have you chosen?</h3>
        
        <p>
            Console.log-ing and pseudocoding. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>How will you implement these techniques into your day to day coding flow? How will you make sure that you actually do them?</h3>
        
        <p>
            Pseudocoing will force me to plan out what I am actually attempting to do instead of jumping the gun straight away and going straight to coding which I can do sometimes. I will make sure I at least have a rough pseudocode written to know what my steps are.
            Console.log-ing seems like a nice way to problem solve without leaving the text editor. It will catch a lot of errors that I dont think about or cant see, so when I encounter something not working correctly. I want to make that my first method of seeing what the problem is.
        </p>
        
        
        
        
        <h1>JavaScript Variables and Object Types</h1>

        <hr>
        
        <h3>How did you find working through the Variables and Objects kata?</h3>
        
        <p>
            I found it pretty simple, none of the problems had me stuck. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Did you look at the tests while coding the kata? Was it helpful?</h3>
        
        <p>
            I pretty much tested after every change I made, it makes it a lot easier to back and forth when you change things rather than making a lot of changes and then not knowing what part isnt working.
        </p>
        
        
        
        <h1>Manipulating JavaScript Objects</h1>

        <hr>
        
        <h3>What was the highlight of this kata for you?</h3>
        
        <p>
            I think the satisfaction overall of solving problems without Google or lots of frustration is the highlight of exercises like these.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Did you find you preferred following the steps given to you or using the test outputs in your repl? Why?</h3>
        
        <p>
            I preffered to use the Repl.it output. It allowed me to keep everything focussed on one window instead of jumping between two. I also prefer to look at the thing giving me the outputs incase theres any weird mismatches in data.
        </p>
        
        
        
        <h1>FizzBuzz (Super Edition)</h1>

        <hr>
        
        <h3>What was the most challenging part of Super FizzBuzz for you?</h3>
        
        <P>
            I think my idea was fine on how to get the job done. But there were a lot of specifics that had me going back and forth trying to solve. Aspects such as the order of my statements as well as the manner in which I was trying to execute them was usually missing a symbol or was stated incorrectly.
            The solution was usually a quick Rubber Ducky explanation or a google of the method I was trying to execute. (at no point did I search how to solve FizzBuzz so I am proud of that!).
        </P>
        
        <h3>How did you find using pseudocode during this kata?</h3>
        
        <p>
            Psuedo code was useful at the start of the exercise. I had a clear idea of what was going on in each statement as well as what each statement needed to achieve. It also kept things slightly more readable.
        </p>
        
        
        
        <h1>JavaScript Gradebook</h1>

        <hr>
        
        <h3>What was a surprising moment for you in this Gradebook Kata?</h3>
        
        <p>
            I think I found this more challenging than the previous Katas. But what is suprising and what is slowly becoming more regular is the fact that I can see a problem and have an idea as to how to fix it. 
            Before it was a case of going I have no idea what I am doing and need guidance on everything, where as now I can build the base code of a problem and then figure out the things I dont know and need to learn to get a solution.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Did you go back and rewrite code as you got to new steps? Is there anything you would change about your final code?</h3>
        
        <p>
            I didn't adjust too much code after solving the problem. I certainly expect my method not to be the smartest or most efficient way. But I dont want to get too focussed on that when I still have a lot of basics to learn.
            Looking at a copy of the solutions, there are a good amount of things I would change. Mainly just keeping it DRY and not adding things that arent neccesary outside of testing. 
        </p>
        
        
        
        <h1>Built-in Methods</h1>

        <hr>
        
        <h3>On a scale of 1 - 5, 5 means 'These built in methods are hard!' and 1 means 'Built in methods are easy.  Piece of cake' - how are you feeling following this Built-In-Methods kata? </h3>
        
        <p>
            I would say 4. I found this difficult because doing research online can take you to a million different solutions and it can be hard to know what is worth exploring further. I do feel that these will become much easier later on once their purpose becomes a little bit more autonomous.
            But for now there is a lot of reading over notes and web articles to remember what each built in method does.
        </p>
        
        
        <h3>What resources did you use to help you? How useful did you find them?</h3>
        
        <p>
            I always ended up on either MDN, YouTube or Stack Overflow. I found Stack Overflow was more confusing because forums were related to much more complex problems but seeing how others write code isnt a bad thing. For methods, MDN and YouTube were the most reliable because they gave all of the details about the method. 
        </p>

        <h1>JavaScript Olympics</h1>

        <hr>
        
        <h3>Did you find this took a longer or shorter time than you expected? Why?</h3>
        
        <p>
            I think it was definitely shorter than expected, but it had many problems along the way. I find the testing side of things difficult because I often had a solution to the problem but found that the test wanted it done a certain way. Those were where I found my major blocks, which was a little bit frustrating seeing as 
            I did have a working solution. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>If you were to complete the kata again, what would you do differently next time?</h3>

        <p>
            I would probably spend less time worrying about why a test wasnt passing even with working code. Next time I would just comment out the code and then move on to the other problems and then come back at the end. I ended up doing this but much later than I should have.
