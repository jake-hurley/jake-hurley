    <h2 class="post-title">Problem Solving.</h2>



    <h3 class="question">What happened when I got blocked by a simple problem?</h3>
    <h4><em>Was the solution Elegant? or a bit of a Mess?</em></h4>

    <p>
        A time where I got blocked by a relatively simple problem in hindsight was during the Super FizzBuzz Kata. I had all of my code working in their individual pieces. But overall when executed together, it wasnt working properly.
        Even with Pseudo Code written out it didnt make sense to me why it wasnt working. So I did something similar to the Rubber Duckey Method and sat there and had a little explanation session with myself, explaining what my code is trying to do.
        As well as the problem that was popping up. Then after a couple of repititions of that, I realised that the order of execution was causing the issue and the simple solution was to swap around one block of code with another.
        I learnt that for me being verbal with what was happening, and explaining to myself what was going on helped me understand why the errors were occuring instead of seeing the Red text and trying to straight away code my way out of it.

    <h3 class="question">Problem Solving Techniques that I found useful.</h3>

    <ul>
        
        <li>
            <h4 class="point">Psudeo Code.</h4>
            <p>
                I found Pseudo Coding super useful not only for solving problems, but also keeping code clean and DRY. In cases where I didnt use it straight away to structure my code, I would usually end up coming back to it at a later time anyway. For me seeing a structure already set out infront of me kept me focussed on what I am
                actually trying to do rather than going on some random tangent to fix a simple problem. I am trying to build the habit of making Pseudo Code the first step in my workflow.

        <li>
            <h4 class="point">Trying Something.</h4>

            <p>
                This is a very common thing I do, I dont like resorting to others when I have not made a really good attempt myself. I try my best to make sure I have tried all the ways I think a solution will be solved first, keeping in mind that there is a lot I dont know and cant be expected to know so early in the piece.
                I think I am guilty of spending too much time trying to solve a problem myself when a quick message to a friend or facilitator could have fixed it much more quickly.

        <li>
            <h4 class="point">Rubber Duckey Method.</h4>

            <p>
                I really like this method. For me talking myself or a Rubber Duckey through my problem and also trying to explain why I think an error is occuring makes things a lot more clear to me. I can recount a couple of times already where I had a 'Eureka' moment after explaining everything. For me it is just a different way
                of seeing the problem instead of trying to read the code itself. I think this is mainly due to the fact that I am not fully used to looking at code and seeing problems naturally yet.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4 class="point">Reading Error Messages.</h4>

            <p>
                Reading Errors is usually the first thing I look at before solving a problem. Mainly because it tells me the main reason why a problem is occuring as well as where it is so that I dont try and fix code where it is not broken.

        </li>

        <li>
            <h4 class="point">Console.logging</h4>

            <p>
                I find this method really useful for understanding what each step of my code is outputting. For me it is how I spot the less obvious problems that a conversation with a Rubber Duckey cant solve.

                Everybody does this, sometimes it is good. Some times it is like beating a Dead Horse.

    <h3 class="question">Problem Solving Techniques that I need to utilize more.</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4 class="point">Asking Peers for Help</h4>

            <p>
                I really do need to know when to drop the pride and ask for help. I tend to spend a lot of time trying to solve a problem to make sure that when I ask someone else, it isnt a waste of their time.
                But usually I just end up trying to solve that problem the whole time.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4 class="point">Asking Coaches for help.</h4>

            <p>
                The same problem applies. I tend to spend way too much time trying to solve a problem that most likely would be solved in a fraction of the time if I simply approached a coach about it.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4 class="point">Improving my process with Reflection.</h4>

            <p>
                I certainly see improvement in this, but I still have a habit of completing something and straight away moving onto the next thing without going back and thinking about what went well or what didnt go well. Its a habit I know will be valuable and I 
                definitely need to improve on.
