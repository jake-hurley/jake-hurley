        <h1>Sprint 2 Learning Reflection.</h1>
        
        <h2>What is your Long-Term Goal and or Career Pathway?</h2>

        <p>In a career perspective, my long-term goals branch out into multiple possibilities. One of which would be finding myself in a senior developer role at a company that does work that I care about. I also aspire to one day be able to start my own business, should the opportunity arise. For me it is less about the details like working at a certain company in a certain role, but more so finding a balance of a job that allows me to fund and experience the life I want for myself. I have always been firm on the idea that having a life outside of work has a direct impact on your ability to perform well when at work. So being able to find that balance of work and life is an important thing for me, and obviously it is an understanding that one must work very hard when at work to be able to achieve this.</p>

        <h2>What Human skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>

        <p>I think a skill that I continually want to develop that I have also worked on in previous workplaces, is the skill of being able to adapt to the people that you are working with. I have worked overseas in studios that have a lot of diverse cultures in one place. From experiencing how much impact culture has on the way people work and interact, it showed me how vital flexibility is when it comes to working in teams of different backgrounds and experience. Although I say that I have experienced this before, it is something that I am very far from mastery of and I really want to continually grow on it. </p>

        <h2>Describe your own strengths and limitations.</h2>

        <p>I think above all my greatest strength is my desire to help and lift others. I think I am at my best when I am teaching others something new or helping them in some way. If somebody needs my help, I do my very best to assist them with what they need. I have always seen a limitation to this however, as I can become a bit of a yes man with helping others which often leads to me losing out in some way whether it be losing time to work on my own work/life, or spending a lot of energy helping others which again takes out of my ability to serve myself. I think I will always be like this though, helping others is important to me. I think a skill I need to work on is making sure that I help others in a smarter more efficient way. Another limitation is that I am somebody who admittedly can become easily distractible. I know the things that distract me and when attention is required, I make sure I reduce those distractions, but sometimes distractions are unavoidable, and I need to tell myself that I am getting distracted too much. But to finish on a positive, a strength I have is a strong work ethic towards the things I care about and have a positive mindset around more daunting tasks and challenges.</p>

        <h2>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include – an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h2>
        
        <p>When it comes to the foundations section of Dev-Academy. I have written a daily schedule that includes work time, goals and reflection times, as well as enough break times. I like routine and structure so having this system allows me to remain focussed so that even on days when I am tired and don’t really know what to do, there is something already telling me what is required. One thing I take extremely seriously is Professionalism, and I treat this course very much like a job. So, for me not only is it important to work hard for myself, but also to work hard and be respectful to fellow workmates and facilitators. The nice thing about starting a course is that I know that I don’t know much, and that the Ego stays at home. Everybody has a unique background and skillset to bring to the table so for me its about acknowledging those skills as well as acknowledging my own weaknesses. With this and my scheduled approach to learning in mind, I think I should be able to meet my own expectations of the course so long as I work hard.</p>

        <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h2>

        <p>There are many avenues of help which EDA has kindly suggested. I think slack will be the main form of assistance where I can get help from peers and facilitators through that. Help should only be asked when I have approached it myself and gone through the problem-solving workflow with no success. It is important not to flood other peoples time and effort with tasks that probably would’ve been solved with a bit of persistence or a simple google search.</p>

        <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team. </h2>

        <p>I acknowledge the fact that EDA does not approach the curriculum like that of a regular University in which a lecturer is the source of information and answers. For me my expectation of the facilitators is to act as a guide to keep myself and other students moving in the right direction. Very much like a senior supervisor in a workplace, they don’t sit there and tell you exactly what to do. They will assist when its needed but there is an expectation that the students are accountable for their work and learning that they do.</p>

        <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committee to other things. </h2>

        <p>I have made EDA a priority on my schedule for the length of the course so I don’t have any commitments that will impede my learning time. Things do pop up out of nowhere and I will adapt where needed but currently those blocks are non-existent.</p>
