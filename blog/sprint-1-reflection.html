        <h1 class="sprint-name"> My Reflections - Sprint One </h1> 
        
        <hr> 

        <p>In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:</p>
        
        <h1>Command Line Primer</h1>

        <hr> 
        
        <h3>In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?</h3>
        
        <p>The Command Line is a text version of the Graphical Interface you use to navigate your computers system. 
        Instead of clicking and using Icons to navigate the system, the Command Line uses text based commands and inputs to navigate the computer, usually in a quicker fashion.</p>
        
        
        <h3> Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?</h3>
        
        <p>I roughly stuck to the timeframe but I undershot the time limit mostly. Instead of finishing up early and moving on I think next time I will just look at any stretch material,
        or go over the notes that I wrote in the session.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Name 5 commands you used, and what they do</h3> 
        
        <ul>
            <li>mkdir = make a directory.</li>
            <li>ls = Lists the contents of a directory.</li>
            <li>rm -rf = deletes specified directory.</li>
            <li>cd .. = goes back to previous directory.</li>
            <li>cp = copies a directory.</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h3> Did you learn anything unexpected?</h3>
        
        <p>I did not know about Powershell nor did I realise it was already on my PC as a command tool I could use. </p>
        
        
        
        <h1>Version Control with Git</h1>

        <hr>

        <h3>Whats the difference between git and GitHub?</h3>
        
        <p>Git is the tool that allows a user to branch, commit and pull work to and from their Github Repository.
        Github is the host of the users project where all the versions of the project are stored and viewable for the user and their team.</p>
        
        <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe them?</h3>
        
        <p>An analogy I can think of is a bank account. The bank account is the Github repository where the money(project files) are stored. While the 
        Eftpos card is the Git Tool that allows you to utilize the Money. Using the card(Git) will update the repository(bank account)
        for anyone who has access to the account to see.</p>
        
        <h3>Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?</h3>
        
        <p>I would understand the concept of what it is, but the terminology would be harder to remember and would probably involve me looking through notes or googling the answer.</p>
        
        <h3>Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?</h3>
        
        <p>I stuck to the timeframes this time around, although reflection didn't require quite as much time as it said, so I used the remaining time to brush over notes.</p>
        
        
        
        <h1>Install and Explore Git</h1>

        <h3>What is a GitHub work flow?</h3>
        
        <p>A GitHub work flow involves either creating a repo from a directory using git init, or cloning an existing repo using git clone. 
        From there it is a case of working on files using branches, staging and committing to push the working versions onto the master repo.</p>
        
        <h3>What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?</h3>
        
        <p>I notice that I got into a bit of a flow state rather quickly which was encouraging and I found that because I could see the relation between 
        what I was learning and how useful it would be later on in projects, that I picked up the information a lot easier and enjoyed doing so.
        If there was something that caused confusion or a block, I would take myself further back in the resource and continue in case I missed a detail.</p>
        
        <h3>Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?</h3>
        
        <p>I was quite happy with how this section went, I accidentally continued learning through past section 4 but thats only because I was curious 
        and lost attention to where I was in the course.</p>
        
        
        <h1>Track and Commit Primer!</h1>

        <h3>How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?  </h3>
        
        <p>I would describe it like a package you are sending. The process of staging is when you add the things you want to send and put it into a parcel.
        The process of committing is to send that parcel off to its recipient.</p>
        
        
        
        <h1>Branch, Pull, Merge</h1>

        <!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->
        
        <h3>What is Master?</h3>
        
        <p>Master is the main Repo that contains all of the approved features that have been worked on in other branches. It is what contains the final deployable product.</p>
        
        <h3>Why create a Branch?</h3>
        
        <p>Creating a branch allows you to make any changes or additions to features without affecting the master. This means that if something breaks, it will not affect the 
        most important part of the repo. It also allows for multiple people to work on features and bugs at one time without impacting eachothers work or slowing productivity in any way.</p>
        
        <h3>Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?</h3>
        
        <p>The concepts themselves are easy enough to understand. I have worked with similar workflows in previous jobs. Although I am yet to fully understand all of the git commands, 
        with repitition and time spent using git, I think I will be able to pick it up relatively smoothly.</p>
        
        
        
        
        <h1>GitHub Fork & Clone</h1>

        <hr>
        
        <!-- Answer the following questions -->
        
        <h3>What are some examples of when you would fork?</h3>
        
        <p>Perhaps you are looking at an open source project with lots of contributors. In order to make changes without affecting or potentially breaking the main product,
        it is best to create a fork. This allows you to make all the changes you want to the master without affecting the actual project because you have forked it into your own 
        personal repo.</p>
        
        <h3>Write your own step-by-step fork and clone instructions. Describe what you did.</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>When you want to Fork a repo, in GitHub click the Fork button located on the right of the screen.</li>
            <li> Select which developer account you want to Fork the repo into.</li>
            <li> Clone the forked repo onto your local computer.</li>
            <li> In GitBash, make any branches and changes to files/features that you need.</li>
            <li> When finished with your feature or fix. Stage (git add -A) and commit (git commit -m "message") the files and push (git push origin branchName) them onto the forked    Repo.</li>
            <li> Submit a Pull Request to the owner or head developer of the origin repo. If approved, this will merge the changes you made on you repo with the origin.</p></li>
            <li> Delete any branches that are not needed after the merge is complete.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?</h3>
        
        <p>I think I understood initially what I was trying to do. But the point where it clicked was when I went through and did the whole process and it worked. It just confirmed that
        what I was thinking was correct, intially I was unsure if that was right. The concepts of the process make a lot of sense to me so that clicked earlier than the commands.</p>
        
        
        
        <h1>Setup Repo & Create Blog</h1>

        <hr>
        
        <h3>Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?</h3>
        
        <p>The point of most frustration was mainly just navigating the settings. I am not used to the ins and outs of GitHub yet so navigation isn't autonomous yet.</p>
        
        <h3>If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made; was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?</h3>
        
        <p>I am aware of the process of making websites outside of GitHub (although I havent fully deployed one myself) but that only involved me working on a project without Git or GitHub.</p>
        
        
        
        <h1>Thinking like a programmer</h1>

        <hr>
        
        <h3>Describe the process for solving problems</h3>
        
        <p>The process of solving a problem involves making a calculated, strategic apporach to overcoming a 
        problem rather than blindly hacking away hoping that a solution will stick. The approach involves 
        understanding the problem that needs to be solved, breaking that problem down into sub problems, and 
        creating a plan or roadmap to fixing said problem. Effective problem solving also includes refactoring and reflection once a problem has been solved so that it is solved well and that the solution has been understood and learned from.</p>
        
        <h3>Will you follow that process? How?</h3>
        
        <p>I want to train myself to make this approach a habit. This requires me to use these methods as often as possible in any problem solving situation, even if I know its a google search away. Although there is nothing wrong with quickly googling an answer. Developing the habit of going through the process to solve a problem is the best way for the habit to stick.</p>
        
        <h3>What did you learn about flipped classroom?</h3>
        
        <p>I learnt that a Flipped Classroom encourages an Intentional Learning Culture that sees instruction move from the group to the individual. Rather than a Teacher being the source of information and answers, it is passed off to the students and the Teacher acts as more of a guide for the students. When moved back into the group space, it allows for students to practice concepts and ideas through intentional learning exercises compared to simply having concepts explained to them in a traditional classroom setting.</p>
        
        
        
        <h1>Introduce yourself</h1>

        <hr>
        
        <h3>What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? </h3>
        
        <p>A little bit difficult, and a little bit confronting. It can often be hard to make sure what youre saying about yourself actually reflects who you are, I tried my best to make it not sound like a standard job interview answer where you only say the good things about yourself in an exaggerated way. But I like that people in my cohort will have a better idea about who I am and what I am trying to do, as well as where I come from. It will also let me know a bit about the people I am working with.</p>
        
        <h3>Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious? </h3>
        
        <p>For sure! I defintely felt that in writing my introduction, I wanted to be percieved well but also didnt want to sound like a pretentious 'goodie good'. It isnt the worst thing in the world though, expressing the person I want to be to the Cohort gives me an opportunity to make sure I meet the standard that I set for myself.</p>
