        <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset.</h1>

        <h3><em>Learning about Learning.</em></h3>

        <h2 class="best-uses">How does Neuroplasticity benefit people?</h2>

        <p>
          The theoretical principles that revolve around Neuroplasticity suggest that although physical practice and repetition are one of the fastest ways to develop autonomous understanding of a concept, the neural habits of the person and how they think about their ability to learn plays a critical role in the effectiveness of how well that concept is learned. When one understands that the neural pathways in our brains grow and shrink like muscles do when you work out for sustained periods, it creates a greater belief that Intelligence is not inherent nor is the ability to learn something. 
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="best-uses">What I can use with this information to benefit me?</h2>

        <p>
          I believe the key principles of Neuroplasticity that will work in my favour the most are the repetitive habitual principles. I consider myself to be a creature of habit and find reassurance knowing that every time I repeat a task and make it habitual, I am getting better regardless of how fast I am moving. Outside of repetition and habit, I think that I learn concepts significantly better when I can see a plausible relationship between the concept and what I am trying to achieve. In a coding context, being able to see the benefits and uses of a technique or method creates a noticeable boost in my attitude and understanding towards the concept. Whereas if that relation is missing, I find more effort is required to retain what I am learning. 
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="best-uses">What are some ways to increase your Neuroplasticity?</h2>

        <p>
          The common analogy that is used when referring to Neuroplasticity is the Highway being the Neural Pathways and the neurons being cars. Sustained repetition is the key method to strengthening these pathways. A highway does not open and extra lane because of one Car. It requires thousands of Cars constantly passing through for the Neural pathways to justify its own growth to allow for quicker retention of information. When you know what you’re trying to achieve or can find a relation between what you’re learning and a familiar concept, you tend to understand quicker than you would if you couldn’t see the use or benefits of what you’re learning. Continuing with the same analogy, a car moves quicker when it knows the route and the destination. By finding a way to relate what you are learning to either something you already know or something you’re trying to do, the easier it is for that concept to be retained compared to learning the same concept without that connection.

        <h1 class="best-uses">Growth Mindset.</h1>
        
        <h2 class="best-uses">What is a Growth Mindset and why is it relevant?</h2>

        <p>
          Growth Mindset adopts the idea that intelligence and ability is not an inherent, static thing you either have or you do not have. The base principle of the Growth Mindset is the “Not yet” concept. Meaning that those who may be behind or lacking in ability are not simply incapable but rather on their way to being capable. By removing the static idea that you are either intelligent or not intelligent, the Growth Mindset embraces challenging yourself to explore what is difficult or hard to understand with the knowledge that perseverance will eventually pay off. It is relevance to Dev Academy and my learning is significant. I am very much venturing into unknown territory with programming and I know that I do not know very much. For me to maintain enthusiasm and positivity when the difficulty of the curriculum increases, I need to be accepting and embracing of the fact that it is very challenging and my lack of knowledge now does not mean I am incapable of learning it in the coming months. It is already something I think about regularly to keep my headspace outside of a negative and static cloud, which will continue to be a vital thing as the course progresses.
        </p>

        <h2 class="best-uses">When exploring the topic, did anything suprise you? Did anything change for you?</h2>

        <p>
          I think there is often a common disregard for the standard “believe and you will achieve” attitude, simply because it passes itself off as idealistic. But what I guess changed for me was getting some more research under my belt and understanding the plausible theoretical evidence of this attitude being significantly beneficial. It feels a lot less ideal and less of a motivational talk topic, and more like something that makes sense as something with substantial benefit when paired with the physical habits put in place. Perhaps the greater understanding of it is what has caused the noticeable increase in patience when it came to my learning throughout the course so far.
        </p>

        <h2 class="best-uses">Where do I plan to integrate a Growth Mindset into my own Learning Journey?</h2>

        <p>
          I think I have inherently done so simply from learning more about the topic and doing my own research. But in a more literal sense I can see the attitude towards embracing challenge and difficulty to be rather crucial in my ability to stay on course. There is a lot of content and most of which is content I know next to nothing about, so I need to maintain that “not yet” attitude to stay in the game.
