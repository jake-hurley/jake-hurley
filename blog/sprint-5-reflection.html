    <h3>What was the hardest moment of this challenge for you?</h3>
    
    <p>
      I think for me the hardest part of this challenge was coding something around a pre-existing structure. It forces you to be a bit smarter and more calculated with the things you add
      because you have to think about if it will work well alongside the already written code. Once I had a look around and understood what was doing what and what functions were being called,
      I felt much more comfortable with what I was trying to do.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Did you have any blocks during this challenge? How did you overcome them?</h3>
    
    <p>
      I had quite a few blocks especially at the start. I think persistence firstly was an important factor, but also making sure I am thinking about everything the code I am writing is trying to do.
      In most cases a couple of rounds of Rubber Duckey method helped me understand where problems were happening. Ontop of that, finding some internet sources around specific things like random number generation and audio made 
      life much easier.

    <h3>What learnings are you going to take away from this challenge?</h3>
    
    <p>
      I think an important element I need to focus on in other challenges is making sure I am not overlooking the basic solutions. There was a problem I faced in the challenge that was solved by changing where a line of code was placed.
      But because I was looking for more complex methods to solve the problem, when I realised that I had overlooked a really basic solution I got frustrated. So making sure I remember the basic checklist to follow next time is going to save 
      a lot of frustration.

    <h3>If _you_ were responsible for curriculum development at Dev Academy, would you change this challenge in any way? How? Why?</h3>
    
    <p>
      I think it was good in the sense that it didn't hand feed the answers and required some more critical thought around what needed to be done in order to complete the challenge. But at times it seemed a bit unclear on first read through of what
      needed to be done to get things working.

    <h3>Do you have any prior experience pair coding? If so, what was the experience like for you? If not, what is your initial reaction to pair programming?</h3>
    
    
    
    
    <h3>Do you personally think working and pairing with others will be a challenge for you during bootcamp? Why so?</h3>

    <h3>What was the most challenging part of this calculator exercise for you?</h3>
    
    
    
    <h3>What was a highlight?</h3>
    
    
    
    <h3>Which pairing role did you enjoy most? Why?</h3>
    
    
    
    <h3>When the pairing wasn't working well, internally did it feel like "Your Fault"? "Their Fault"? Neither? Both? Did you communicate about it?</h3>
    
    
    
    <h3>Is this anything different you will do the next time you pair on an exercise?</h3>
