    <h3>What was the hardest moment of this challenge for you?</h3>
    
    <p>
      I think for me the hardest part of this challenge was coding something around a pre-existing structure. It forces you to be a bit smarter and more calculated with the things you add
      because you have to think about if it will work well alongside the already written code. Once I had a look around and understood what was doing what and what functions were being called,
      I felt much more comfortable with what I was trying to do.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Did you have any blocks during this challenge? How did you overcome them?</h3>
    
    <p>
      I had quite a few blocks especially at the start. I think persistence firstly was an important factor, but also making sure I am thinking about everything the code I am writing is trying to do.
      In most cases a couple of rounds of Rubber Duckey method helped me understand where problems were happening. Ontop of that, finding some internet sources around specific things like random number generation and audio made 
      life much easier.
    </p>
    
    <h3>What learnings are you going to take away from this challenge?</h3>
    
    <p>
      I think an important element I need to focus on in other challenges is making sure I am not overlooking the basic solutions. There was a problem I faced in the challenge that was solved by changing where a line of code was placed.
      But because I was looking for more complex methods to solve the problem, when I realised that I had overlooked a really basic solution I got frustrated. So making sure I remember the basic checklist to follow next time is going to save 
      a lot of frustration.
    </p>
    
    <h3>If _you_ were responsible for curriculum development at Dev Academy, would you change this challenge in any way? How? Why?</h3>
    
    <p>
      I think it was good in the sense that it didn't hand feed the answers and required some more critical thought around what needed to be done in order to complete the challenge. But at times it seemed a bit unclear on first read through of what
      needed to be done to get things working.

    <h1>Pair Programming</h1>

    <hr>
    
    <h3>Do you have any prior experience pair coding? If so, what was the experience like for you? If not, what is your initial reaction to pair programming?</h3>
    
    <p>
      I do not have any prior experience of pair coding in this way. In past jobs I have sat there watching someone code but that way not at all collaborative.
    </p>
    
    
    <h3>Do you personally think working and pairing with others will be a challenge for you during bootcamp? Why so?</h3>
    
    <p>
      I dont think so, I enjoy working together with people and really enjoy problem solving with others.

    <h1>Inflate the Unicorn</h1>

    <hr>
    
    <h3>Did you Learn anything new during this exercise?</h3>
    
    <p>
      Yes, there were a couple of new features that I had not known about such as the onclick method in Html. I also learnt how important DOM selectors are when it comes to working
      with multiple objects that have the same tag or class.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Did you encounter issues completing any ofhte steps of the exercise? How did you resolve this?</h3>
    
    <p>
      The main issue I encountered was getting the one function to work for all 3 unicorns without changing the other unicorns in the process. The main problem was that I was trying to make
      one function do everything and it was causing problems. After an hour or so of frustration, the solution came down to a friend reminding me of the idea that a function should not have more
      than one purpose. After I realised this it was a pretty quick process to split up the section of the function that updates the counts and that made everything work smoothly. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>If you were to replace the unicorn with another mystical animal of your choice, what would it be?</h3>
    
    <p>
      Probably just a Dragon or something, they are pretty cool.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Whack a Mole</h1>

    <hr>
    
    <h3>What was the hardest part of this exercise?</h3>
    
    <p>
      I think getting used to changing attributes of Html items was the concept that took a little bit longer to grasp. Once I got more comfortable with that section, the challenge became easier to complete.
    </p>

    <h3>Can you think of any different ways you could have accomplished the same outcome?</h3>
    
    <p>
      Not at this stage. Not because my code is amazing and not worth changing. But more so just because I am still pretty elementary with my approach and havent witnessed multiple ways of solving the same problem yet.
      I think when I get a bit more exposure to other peers and colleagues ways of doing things, I will start to see multiple ways around problems I am trying to solve. 
    </p>

    <h3>How did you find the process of Refactoring your code?</h3>

    <p>
      Frustrating. It felt like I was starting the whole challenge all over again. Refactoring is hard because in many cases it causes a lot of the other code to need to be changed. 
      To me it suggests that I might need to plan things a bit better initially instead of getting something working with the knowledge its going to have to be refactored.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Would you do anything differently if you were to start this challenge again?</h3>

    <p>
      Based on my answer to the previous question, I think I need to think harder about how to make something that doesnt require a massive amount of refactoring at the end.
    </p>
    
    <h3>What piece of code are you proudest of from this exercise?</h3>
    
    <p>
      I think I am pretty proud of getting the up down arrows working. When I started to work on that section, I was a bit intimidated with it. There was a little bit of doubt about my ability
      to get it done. So when I overcame the challenge I was really happy!

    <h3>What parts of these challenges did you enjoy? If we were to add more challenges, what would you like to have more of?</h3>

    <p>
      I enjoyed that there was something plausible and visual that I was trying to achieve. Its hard sometimes when youre learning or doing repl.it testing to see something that you can feel good about.
      By having something respond on a webpage exactly how I want it to respond is really satisfying.
    </p>

    <h3>What parts weren't so good? Were there any parts that you felt stuck on?</h3>

    <p>
      I think there were a few cases where I occasionally would repeat myself when it came to solving a problem even when it hadnt worked previously. This cost time and caused a fair amount of frustration.
      Mainly because I swore that the way I was doing it would work but it didnt. 
    </p>

    <h3>Which parts made you feel confident?</h3>

    <p>
      I think I felt a lot more free with these challenges, and the fact that before reading hints and suggestions of how to overcome the challenge. I was already in my head seeing ways to solve the problem on my own.
      I makes my skills feel a little bit more validated as someone who knows a thing or two instead of being 100% newbie who doesnt know anything at all.
    </p>

    <h3>What personally would you want changed to improve the carnival?</h3>
    
    <p>
      personally, I think just adding more challenges would be great! They are really fun and really well balanced in terms of challenge. Any chance to do more things like that is welcomed!
    </p>
