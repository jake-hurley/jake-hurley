        <h1>Foundations Core Reflection.</h1>

        <h3><em>The benefits of Core during Foundations.</em></h3>

        <h2 class="best-uses">What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
        
        <p>
            The first and most important thing I have learned is how important relatability and context is to my learning. I noticed I picked so much more up when I was learning concepts but also applying them into something visual whether it was a blog or a JavaScript challenge. That was where I saw the most rapid progress in learning. Secondly but equally as interesting, I noticed how important breaks were for me during this process. In quite a few cases during challenges when I was stuck, simply going and relaxing for a while without thinking of code resulted in me solving the problem shortly after returning. Lastly from an ego perspective, I feel like I can sometimes expect too much of myself and when I don’t meet that expectation I get frustrated when I don’t know it even though I only just started learning it. I have gotten it more under control compared to the beginning of the course, but it still lingers here and there.
        </p>

        <h2 class="best-uses">What are the role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>

        <p>
            Values are something that I think are not specifically applicable to programming, but rather just everything in general. Your values dictate your decisions and how you interact with others. It is important to have values that either align with or at the least acknowledge the values of those around you. For me, someone with different values is just as important as someone who shares the same values as me. Empathy and self-awareness are very important in a field like programming which has so many facets and languages that nobody could possibly know all of it. It is important to understand and empathize with someone who is experiencing a problem in something they may not be as experienced in. As a beginner in the field, I very much hope that colleagues and supervisors will share that empathy knowing that I have a lot to learn and will if given the time. The same principle can be applied to my own self-awareness. I need to understand I have so much I don’t know, and that the ego needs to stay at home, ensuring I respect my colleagues and clients for the skills and values that they bring to the table.

        <h2 class="best-uses">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>

        <p>
            What has surprised me the most is how introspective it has made me. In many cases its easy to glaze over the classic ‘people skills’ aspect of preparing yourself for a job or experience. But after some regular learning and reflection. I genuinely feel like I have a better grasp on who I am when it comes to learning and how I handle myself in a work environment. When I read over a concept in the core section, I tend to think about whether its something I do and if that’s having a positive or negative impact on what I am trying to do.
        </p>

        <h2 class="best-uses">What were the most challenging aspects of core learning?</h2>

        <p>
            Being honest. I found that sometimes I would answer the questions thinking about what others would think of it if they read it. As I have gotten myself further through foundations, I think I have improved but on the more confronting questions that make you look at your values and you weaknesses, I think it is still a challenge to ensure I am being authentic.
        </p>

        <h2 class="best-uses">What do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>

        <p>
            I think learning to code and program things isn’t actually too difficult, its more so time consuming. I don’t think I would have joined this course if I didn’t feel like I would have gotten something unique out of it that I wouldn’t be able to get on a Udemy course. When you get a bunch of people and stick them into a 9 week bootcamp of a new skill they are trying to learn, a prior understanding of core values of ones self and the others around them is crucial to everybody getting the most out of the course. Not only is this important for the course, but it acts as a way to train someone for the working world. There is no value in letting a person go full intensity into a bootcamp and then tell them afterwards about the core skills that they will need for the working world. I see Bootcamp as an opportunity to match what I have said about myself, my values, and the way that I learn, as well as an opportunity for those more experienced to challenge how I act and respond in a higher pressure environment. 
        </p>

        <h2 class="best-uses">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>

        <p>
            I think it certainly was challenging initially to force myself to sit there and do the core tasks knowing that I just wanted to do the JavaScript challenges that followed it. However, I did understand the value of it and the more I did it the more that value increased. As much as I found learning the coding side of things to be important, I did feel like I wouldn’t have had as much success going through it compared to if I had just ignored core and went straight to coding. Being able to see and acknowledge the value of it made it easier in the later stages of foundations to sit myself down and do core properly.
