        <h1>Mindfulness </h1>

        <hr>

        <h3>Have you done mindfulness or attention training before? </h3>

        <p>I have done it before. Not as a regular routine, but it is something I would like to make a habit of some kind.</p>

        <h3>Are you able to identify any bias you have for or against mindfulness?   </h3>

        <p>In general not really. But on a personal level I feel like I can be stubborn with it every now and then assuming it isnt working for me. But I think thats more so because I dont do it enough for it to have any kind of lasting impact.</p>

        <h3>What did you notice as you were meditating? </h3>

        <p>My head is very very very busy. I consider myself a bit of an overthinker, which doesnt help when it comes to focussing being present. I found that my mind wanders quite easily, I try my best to calmly bring my attention back to the meditation. But depending on what is currently on my mind will determine how easy or not it is to focus back to the present.</p>

        <h3>How did you find the overall experience? </h3>

        <p>I definitely see the benefit of allocating a certain time of the day to meditation/mindfulness. The times where I was able to properly zone into what my body was doing without too many distractions were really nice. It felt good to not have the brain going 100 miles an hour thinking about what else is going on in my life.</p>

        <h3>What's your daily habit commitment? </h3>
            
        <p>Although I havent implemented a habit for mindfulness, I do want to include at least 5 minutes a day to this. I think the best time of day is probably the morning and before I go to bed because I tend to struggle to switch off when I need to. So getting at least one of those times of day is going to be what I want to commit to.</p>



        <h1>Listening and Looping </h1>

        <hr>

        <h3>What was it like to be fully listened to? </h3>

        <p>I think its nice to hear someone else say what I am thinking. If I am explaining something to someone, I try my best to make it understandable which inherently helps me because I end up thinking a lot about the feelings and challenges I am facing which leads to a better self awarness/understanding of what Im doing. It also feels good when it is understood by the listener and tends to make me feel a little bit better about my challenges because Im not getting a "how do you not understand something so basic", or "that doesn't make any sense" from the listener.</p>

        <h3>What was it like to fully listen?</h3>

        <p>Being able to hear what someone else with a completely different background is experiencing and finding challenging was really refreshing. It is quite easy in a self driven learning environment to beat yourself down and feel like you arent doing as well as others. I found a lot of relation to what the speaker was saying which made the listening and looping back aspect easier. I found that by focussing on what they were saying, I was taking my mind off of all the things I had to do because I wanted to properly hear what they were thinking. In a way it sort of reminds me of the headspace exercises, but you are instead focussing on the present of someone else and trying to be empathetic and understanding to what they are experiencing.</p>




        <h1>Learning JavaScript</h1>

        <hr>

        <h3>What did you notice about your learning style? What resources worked for you and why? </h3>

        <p>I learn better when I have a concept that I can relate to a certain task or exercise. Reading a concept and what it does tends to not be taken onboard as effectively if I dont understand what that concept is used for specifically. The freeCodeCamp exercises were great because I was practicing as I learnt instead of only taking notes. I think I would have liked it more if there was a more literal example of why I would use a certain technique but when there wasnt that explanation, I usually just googled the useful application for the techinque anyway. I hope there are more exercises involving FreeCodeCamp throughout the remainder of foundations.</p>

        <h3>Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?</h3>

        <p>I did the timeboxes quicker in most cases. I found it easy to understand the basics, perhaps because a lot of the concepts being things I knew already from my small understanding of a different programming language. However the harder it got, the harder I found it to move on because I didnt fully understand it. Even now after going through and completing all the challenges. I still feel like some concepts like recursion aren't fully cemented in my head. I think for me its more important to acknowledge the things Im not fully understanding and make sure I note it somewhere to return to at a later date. I have noticed that this works when I give it some time and come back later after doing something different.</p>

        <h3>If you did this entire exercise again, would you get stuck at the same points as you did the first time? Where did you get stuck?  </h3>

        <p>I think some concepts would still have me scratching my head in some points. Overall I would be able to do a better job of the exercises. But not entirely as I know that there are a lot of concepts that arent autonomous in my brain yet.</p>




        <h1>The DOM Primer and DevTools Primer</h1>

        <hr>

        <h3>Were you interested or bored during this exercise? Which parts were interesting? Which parts were boring?</h3>

        <p>I found myself pretty bored during this section, again its one of those things I know a little bit about already so it made re-reading things a little bit tedious. DOM manipulation is definitely one of the interesting aspects of this section that I want to spend a lot of time on, but in a practical doing sense. There are a lot of branches of information on the topic so I found it hard to actually know where to look and determine what is useful or not useful in the context of a beginner just trying to learn the fundamentals. 
        </p>

        <h3>How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?</h3>

        <p>I have 10 tabs open, 9 are study related. 1 is not. It was a google search for a random thought in my head.</p>



        <h1>DevTools Tutorial</h1>

        <hr>

        <h3>What did you notice about your learning style, strengths and limitations when doing this crash course?</h3>



        <h3>Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?</h3>



        <h3>Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name or some inappropriate words into the DOM of a website? If not, do so now. It's hilarious and a great way to amuse your non-technical friends. They will think you are a hacker wizard.</h3>
