        <h1>Sprint 1 Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration.</h1>

        <h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h2>

        <p>The easiest to describe situation that challenged my values was one night I was walking to the gym; it was dark and as I was walking through an empty Carpark. I came across a $100 Note on the ground in front of me. My first reaction was to look around to see if someone may have dropped it. There was nobody around nor did I pass anyone on the way to finding the note. There were no cars in the car park either. At this point I knew I wouldn’t find the rightful owner of the Money which would have been the ideal situation. So, the things I had to weigh up in my head were what the consequences of taking or leaving the note would be. I knew I would feel too guilty to take the note for myself, but I also knew if I left it that whoever finds it may not be the owner and might just keep it for beer money. As a compromise, the best alternative I could think of that I thought could at least do some good was to take the money but then donate the same amount of money out of my bank account to a charity which at the time was the Christchurch attack victims fund. I figured that the owner of the note will be annoyed that they lost the money, but I’m sure they would find some relief to know that it ended up helping somebody out.</p>

        
        <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity. </h2>

        <p>Being an NZ European, I consider myself to fall under the idea of “Kiwi” culture. It may not be as rich in history or as old as other cultures. But it certainly has had an influence over my Identity and the person I try to be.  A quote that has stuck with me perhaps due to its simplicity is “look after your Mates”. Although it is simple and rather obvious in its meaning, I find it to be a very easy way to remind myself of the person I try to be as well as where I come from. Due to New Zealand being a small and rather isolated place, there is a large dependency on those around you as well as yourself to look after each other. It isn’t odd to hear of stories about Kiwis doing amazing things for other people, locally or internationally. In most cases when asked why they decided to do such a noble thing for a stranger, the answer more often than not would resemble something as relaxed as “it’s just what you do”. Although the idea of being a good person who helps others is something commonly shared between many cultures and ideals, I think the part that makes it the most ‘Kiwi’ is the idea that you help anyone who needs it, not because its good karma or that you may be rewarded. But because “it’s just what you do”. That’s the idea I have been raised on and is an idea I try my best to centre my identity around. </p>


        <h2>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations. Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development. </h2>

        <p>A strength that certainly assists with my ability to learn is my enjoyment towards helping others. In the context of a workplace, If somebody needs help with something I will either know the solution and be able to help them thus strengthening my knowledge of the topic, or if I don’t know the solution I usually go off and try do my own research or try to find somebody who can assist in the problem because I want to do my best to help. The negative of this is that often I can become a bit of a “yes man” and put my own work and schedule on hold for someone else that may slow down my learning of something else. So, it is a bit of a double-edged sword. Another aspect that assists my learning is that I hold myself to a high standard of work and performance. This means I put a lot of effort and analysis into my work. This is great when it comes to learning because I always want to work hard and overcome the obstacles of not knowing certain topics or skills. However, it can result in unrealistic expectations of myself in certain situations where something is more difficult to learn or overcome. I try my best to be patient with my colleagues and people around me in general, but in many cases I am a pretty impatient person when it comes to my own tasks and learning. There are times where I get frustrated at myself when I can’t get something right or if I have had to revise something multiple times. I consider this a definite limitation that I want to improve on throughout my learning journey because I am branching into an unfamiliar field with a lot of challenges lined up in the near future.</p>

        
        <h2>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h2>

        <p>In a previous role I worked in at a Canadian Visual Effects Studio, majority of the artists were from overseas. A new colleague from Thailand started working and was stationed at the desk next to mine. The Studio had a very tricky workflow system that required a lot of understanding to be able to use, however my Colleague also faced the challenge of not being very good with his English. This made it hard to understand the problems that he was having as well as being difficult to explain solutions to him. This caused some tension because it resulted in a lot of repetition of basic concepts. Because of this I decided that a new approach was needed because I could tell we were both feeling pressured and frustrated. My first strategy was more for myself to empathize with the fact that its harder for him to understand because he’s learning it in a language, he isn’t familiar with. Secondly, I chose to take a more visual approach, one that I applied to myself when I was learning the system. I showed him a visual flowchart I drew up months before showing how the system worked and how to use it. I suggested he use this to draw one himself using mine as a guide. Although it was still a slow process, I noticed that he was picking up concepts quicker than he did when I was verbally explaining it to him. Reflecting on the situation, I think the visual route was a good approach, I think the major fault was that I spent to much time repeating a method of teaching that simply wasn’t getting through to him. I would have introduced the visual approach sooner if I could repeat the process.</p>
