        <h3><em>Thinking about Feeling.</em></h3>

        <h2 class="best-uses">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>

        <p>Emotional Intelligence is the knowledge and awareness of one’s own mind and body as well as that of others. Having a higher Emotional Intelligence doesn’t mean you are better at being happy, but more so understanding your own emotional patterns and have a greater awareness of how those emotions come across as well as how to regulate them in a healthy way. Your own emotional intelligence also plays a critical role in your ability to empathize with the feelings of others around you.</p>
        
        <h2 class="best-uses">How is it different to IQ?</h2>

        <p>IQ tends to be a more literal and plausible gage of intelligence. It can be channelled through how well a certain technical skill is displayed, or our ability to solve a complex problem with logic and reasoning.  EQ deals more in the ability to recognize, control and properly express our own emotions as well as being able to perceive the emotions of others. While high IQ is helpful when it comes to identifying someone adept at solving problems and challenges. High EQ identifies leaders, managers and individuals who can work well with teams and cultivate a high performing personal environment. </p>
        
        <h2 class="best-uses">Why is Emotional Intelligence important?</h2>

        <p>It is important because emotions and the feelings of an individual have a significant influence on their ability to perform. Training your Emotional Intelligence helps you in recognizing those feelings, understanding why you feel that way as well as what eases/exasperates that feeling. The more one can train themselves to process their emotions in a healthy way, the better they can perform in a team environment. This isn’t a workplace exclusive skill either, it applies to every aspect of one’s life due to the simple fact that we feel and process emotions every minute we are awake. </p>
