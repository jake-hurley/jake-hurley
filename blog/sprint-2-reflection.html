        <h3>Describe what you did in this exercise. Did you understand the steps that you were making? Can you describe them in simple terms?</h3>

        I created a new set of directories and files inside an existing repo. I created an html file and pasted a template into it. I also created a css stylesheet and linked it with the html page. 

        <h3>Did you achieve the learning competencies and keep within the timebox?</h3>

        I got through the session quite quickly, I have some minor experience already with html and css so understanding what I was doing didnt take too long.
