        <h1>Your Blog </h1>

        <h3>Describe what you did in this exercise. Did you understand the steps that you were making? Can you describe them in simple terms?</h3>

        <p>I created a new set of directories and files inside an existing repo. I created an html file and pasted a template into it. I also created a css stylesheet and linked it with the html page. </p>

        <h3>Did you achieve the learning competencies and keep within the timebox?</h3>

        <p>I got through the session quite quickly, I have some minor experience already with html and css so understanding what I was doing didnt take too long.</p>



        <h1>Learn HTML and CSS </h1>

        <hr>

        <h3>What resources did you use during this challenge? Why did you choose those ones? </h3>

        <p>I used freeCodeCamp. I wanted to take a more practical approach to learning HTML and CSS. I found it was nice being able to have a way of seeing if what I am learning is actually retained instead of watching a video and assuming that I will remember it. </p>


        <h3>What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?</h3>

        <p>Something I have always had a bit of trouble with in CSS is positioning. I learnt a lot more about it in FreeCodeCamp, the strategy was to simply pay extra attention to it in my exercises as well as seeking more resources online to assist with my understanding of what I was doing wrong and how to approach positioning differently.</p>

        <h3>What are of you proud of from during this challenge?</h3>

        <p>I think there was a lot of satisfaction in the FreeCodeCamp exercises. Being able to create your own html and CSS in the browser and then see it being run correctly was a nice way to positively encourage myself to keep focussed. Getting through all the required sections plus one or two more sections with not too much trouble was something I was really happy with.  </p>

        <h3>Did you keep within the timebox suggestions?</h3>

        <p>I got through the sections quicker than what I expected, but to make the use of the extra time available, I did a couple more sections in the FreeCodeCamp curriculum to try and further my CSS knowledge. I am considering utilizing the feature more perhaps if I need more stretch materials. </p>

        <h3>How much faster could you do it if you started from the beginning again, right now?</h3>

        <p>I think with the small amount of html and CSS I did before starting the course, it made this section smoother than expected. However after learning all of the extra things I didnt know, I would likely be able to run through these courses much quicker and more efficiently.</p>



        <h1>Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge</h1>

        <hr>

        <h3>Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  </h3>

        <p>Meet HTML and CSS. They work together to make books! It was not always like this though. Before they met eachother, HTML was an author and a good one at that. However, nobody ever read his great stories because the cover was ugly and there were no pictures. CSS was also an author, he made amazing looking covers and had beautiful pictures to accompany his writing. The only problem was that his stories were boring and nobody finished reading his books.
          One fateful day when they both visited their favorite bookstore "Chromebooks" they bumped into eachother. HTML noticed how beautiful CSS's book covers looked and asked him "did you make those?". HTML had an amazing idea that the two should linkup and work together! From that day on, every book that HTML wrote was accompanied by the beautiful covers and pictures of CSS.   </p>


        <h3>What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them? </h3>

        <p>The main obstacle for me was getting the position of elements right in CSS. I wanted to try and apply a bit of everything that I learnt in FreeCodeCamp without overcrowding the blog page. But to keep it clean I needed to correctly position everything. It came down to a bit more research as to how to position elements in the way that I wanted. I figure that this will be a regular approach because every layout is different and will have its own problems.  </p>

        <h3>Any moments of surprise or joy? </h3>

        <p>Launching the blog page on my browser and seeing that the little keyframe animation I created actually worked. Nothing lifechanging, but definitely nice to see some kind of a visual progression of my learning!</p>

        <h3>If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?</h3>

        HTML would be a Dog, because it understands basic commands and pretty much everyone gets along with it. CSS would be a peacock because it is only known for how pretty it is and how it boasts its looks to others.
